Problems and Questions
----------------------

Listed below are some common questions and troubleshooting issues,
as well as possible solutions or workarounds:

Problem: How do I use my Logitech WingMan RumblePad controller with Marble Blast?

Solution: Bring up the console by hitting ~ (tilde) and type: 
enableJoystick(); followed by <ENTER>.  You can hide the console by 
hitting ~ again.  To disable the gamepad support bring up the console 
and type disableJoystick();

Problem: I don't have a WingMan, but I do have gamepad XYZ... will that
work?

Solution: Quite possibly!  Your gamepad must have two analog sticks - and
the controls for jumping and using powerups are by default mapped to 
the trigger buttons.  If you're a scripting whiz, you can look in
the file marble/client/scripts/default.bind.cs
                           
Problem: The game brings up a dialog saying it can't find a 
compatible display device.

Solution: Make sure the drivers for you graphics card are up to
date.  Marble Blast requires an OpenGL or D3D compatible graphics accelerator.

Problem: I turned on stencil shadows, and my frame rate is
terrible!

Solution: Make sure your desktop bit depth is set to 32 bits.
If your frame rate problems persist, turn off stencil shadows.

Problem: I get clicks and pops in the sounds when the marble is 
rolling around.

Solution: Some on-board sound processors have problems with 
Marble Blast.  Try updating your audio drivers or get a new 
sound card.

Problem: I have a really big/wide monitor and Marble Blast doesn't
let me access all the different resolution settings of my monitor!!!

Solution: You can manually set your fullscreen resolution from the
in-game console.  Press the tilde key (~) to access the console, and
then type: 
listResolutions();
This should display a list of all the resolutions your monitor and
video card support.  You can then set the resolution manually with
the setResolution() command like:
setResolution(1600, 1200, 32);
Pressing the ~ again will cause the console to go away.

Problem: Your easy listening music is cramping my marble style...
how do I play my own rockin' tunes in this game?

Solution: Marble Blast looks for files with the .ogg extension
in subdirectories of the "My Games/Marble Blast Gold/marble" 
directory.  To play your own tunes, just drop any ogg/vorbis encoded file (.ogg)
into the "My Games/Marble Blast Gold/marble" directory.  
If you want to get rid of the music that ships with the game, remove the 
.ogg files from the "My Games/Marble Blast Gold/marble/data/sound"
directory.

Problem: The Gold Time on level XYZ is way too low!  It is clearly
impossible to get such a low time!

Solution: Try again.  All of the gold times are possible to achieve
without cheating... but some of them are VERY hard to get.

Problem: I have some other problem not listed above.
